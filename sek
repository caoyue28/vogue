At the monetary policy meeting on 6 September 2017, the Executive Board of the Riksbank decided to change the target variable for monetary policy from the CPI to the CPIF and to start using a variation band to illustrate that the development of inflation is uncertain.
It also decided to hold the repo rate unchanged at â€“0.50 per cent.
The first rate increase is expected to occur in mid-2018, which is the same assessment as in the Monetary Policy Report in July.
The purchases of government bonds will continue during the second half of 2017, as decided by the Executive Board in April.
The Executive Board agreed on the picture of economic development and the inflation outlook described in the draft Monetary Policy Report
