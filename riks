At the Monetary Policy Meeting on 25 October 2017, the Executive Board of the Riksbank decided to hold the repo rate unchanged at âˆ’0.50 per cent. The first rate increase is expected to be made in the middle of 2018, which is the same assessment as made at the meeting in September. The purchases of government bonds will continue during the second half of 2017, as decided by the Executive Board in April. As the present asset purchase programme will run for the remainder of the year, it will provide an opportunity to await further information that could affect a decision in December to possibly extend the purchases. The Executive Board has also decided to extend the mandate that facilitates a quick intervention on the foreign exchange market
